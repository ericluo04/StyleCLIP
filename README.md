>**Abstract:** Inspired by the ability of StyleGAN to generate highly realistic
images in a variety of domains, much recent work has
focused on understanding how to use the latent spaces of
StyleGAN to manipulate generated and real images. However,
discovering semantically meaningful latent manipulations
typically involves painstaking human examination of
the many degrees of freedom, or an annotated collection
of images for each desired manipulation. In this work, we
explore leveraging the power of recently introduced Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models in order
to develop a text-based interface for StyleGAN image
manipulation that does not require such manual effort. We
first introduce an optimization scheme that utilizes a CLIP-based
loss to modify an input latent vector in response to a
user-provided text prompt. Next, we describe a latent mapper
that infers a text-guided latent manipulation step for
a given input image, allowing faster and more stable textbased
manipulation. Finally, we present a method for mapping
a text prompts to input-agnostic directions in StyleGANâ€™s
style space, enabling interactive text-driven image
manipulation. Extensive results and comparisons demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches.
